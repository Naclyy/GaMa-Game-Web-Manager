                    Description:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    League of Legends is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. 
                    Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. 
                    Since its release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play, and is monetized through purchasable character customization.
                    The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
                    In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their own half of the map. 
                    Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. 
                    During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. 
                    In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "nexus", a large structure located within it.
                    League of Legends received generally positive reviews, critics highlighting its accessibility, character designs, and production value. 
                    The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with reviews trending positively. 
                    The player base's negative and abusive in-game behavior, criticized since early in the game's lifetime, persists despite attempts by Riot to fix the problem. 
                    In 2019, the game regularly peaked at eight million concurrent players, and its popularity has led to tie-ins such as music videos, comic books, short stories, and an upcoming animated series. 
                    Its success has also spawned several spin-off video games, including a mobile version and a digital collectible card game. A massively multiplayer online role-playing game is in development.
                    The game is often cited as the world's largest esport, with an international competitive scene composed of 13 leagues. 
                    The 2019 League of Legends World Championship had over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a concurrent viewership of 44 million, with a minimum prize pool of US$2.5 million. 
                    The North American league is broadcast on cable television sports channel ESPN.

                    Gameplay:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities from an isometric, or top-down, perspective.
                    Over the course of a match, champions gain levels by gaining experience points (XP) through killing non-player enemies called minions.
                    Items also increase the strength of champions, and are bought using gold earned by killing minions, or destroying enemy structures.
                    In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu that is only available to players when their champion is in the team's base.
                    Each match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one match to another

                <h3>
                    Summoner's Rift:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the most prominent in professional-level play.
                    The mode has a ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's skill level and generates a starting rank from which they can climb. 
                    There are nine tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver, and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger.
                    Two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's nexus, which is guarded by the enemy champions and defensive structures known as turrets.
                    Each team's nexus is located in their base, beside the "fountain"—where players start the game or reappear after a death.
                    Minions, which are not controlled by players, are generated from each team's three inhibitors. 
                    These inhibitors are structures located behind the third tower of each lane. Destroying one of the enemy team's inhibitors causes stronger allied minions to spawn in that lane.
                    Minions advance toward the opposing team's base along three lanes guarded by turrets: top, middle, and bottom.
                    In the "jungle"—the region between lanes—are "monsters" that, like minions, reappear at regular intervals. 
                    Like minions, monsters provide gold and XP when killed.
                    Another, more powerful class of monster resides within the river that separates each team's jungle.
                    These monsters require multiple players to defeat and grant special abilities to their slayers' team.
                    For example, a team that slays Baron Nashor greatly increases the durability of their minions, making it difficult for enemy players to clear them.
                    Summoner's Rift matches can last from as little as 15 minutes to over an hour.
                    The top and middle lanes have one champion each per side; the bottom lane has two.
                    Players in a lane kill minions to accumulate gold and XP ("farming") and try to prevent their opponent from doing the same.
                    A fifth champion, known as a "jungler", farms the jungle monsters and, when powerful enough, assists their teammates in a lane.
                    Although the game does not enforce where players may go, conventions have arisen over the game's lifetime.

                <h3>
                    Other modes:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Besides Summoner's Rift, League of Legends has two other permanent game modes. 
                    ARAM ("All Random, All Mid") is a five-versus-five mode like Summoner's Rift, but with only one long lane, no jungle area, and with champions randomly chosen for players.
                    Given the small size of the map, players must be vigilant in avoiding enemy abilities.
                    Teamfight Tactics is an auto battler released in June 2020.
                    As with others in its genre, players build a team and battle to be the last one standing. 
                    Players do not directly affect combat, but position their units on a board for them to fight automatically against opponents each round.
                    Teamfight Tactics is available for mobile operating systems iOS and Android, and has cross-platform play with the Windows and macOS clients.
                    Other game modes have been made available on a temporary basis. 
                    Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was available for 2 weeks as a 2014 April Fools Day prank. 
                    In the mode, champion abilities have no resource cost, significantly reduced cooldown timers, increased movement speed, reduced healing, and faster attacks.
                    URF was available for two weeks. 
                    A year later, in April 2015, Riot disclosed that they had not brought the mode back because its unbalanced design resulted in player "burnout". 
                    The developer also said the costs associated of maintaining and balancing URF were too high.
