                    Description:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a first-person shooter video game which is a part of the Counter-Strike series.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    It was announced to the public on August 12, 2011, and is developed by Valve Corporation and their partner, Hidden Path Entertainment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game was later released on August 21, 2012 for the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, and OS X and later Linux as a downloadable title. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Gameplay:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Counter-Strike: Global Offensive makes a few adjustments to the original gameplay formula of the Counter-Strike series. 
                    Compared to Counter-Strike: Source, weapon damage models were rebalanced. There is improved bullet penetration through some walls, materials, and objects.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The Radio Commands for bots and players have been updated, among other changes.
                    Economy has been modified. Ammunition no longer needs to be purchased.
                    In addition to the graphical updates, the HUD, crosshair and buy menu VGUI has been updated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game features a Competitive Matchmaking system based on ELO ranks and Skill groups.
                    The game has support for dedicated servers on PC and Mac only.
                    Leaderboards were included in initial release, but were cut in the February 17, 2016 update.
                    The game allows cross-platform multiplayer play between Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. PlayStation 3 was previously said to be included, but later dropped.
                    Tips and Hints are added to the map loading screen, while Fun facts were added to round-ends that describe interesting facts that happened in the round. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Game Modes:

                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    At launch, Global Offensive had a total of 16 official maps: 8 updated classic maps, and 8 brand new maps for the Arsenal game mode. More maps were added to the game in later patches.
                    Maps added in post-release can only be accessed through the PC version of the game.

                    Global Offensive has one of the most popular esport scenes in the world. 
                    The Global Offensive professional scene consists of leagues and tournaments hosted by third-party organisations, and Valve-sponsored tournaments known as Major Championships.
                    Majors are considered the most prestigious tournaments in Counter-Strike circuit and have among the largest prize pools; originally announced at US$250,000, the prize pools for Majors have risen to US$1,000,000 since MLG Columbus 2016.
                    Astralis is the most successful Global Offensive team of all time, with the core members of that team winning four Majors together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2014, the "first large match fixing scandal" in the Global Offensive community took place, where team iBuyPower purposefully lost a match against NetCodeGuides.com. 
                    The team was permanently banned from all Majors by Valve, although some other organizers eventually allowed the players to compete at their tournaments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Esports organizations Cloud9 and Dignitas, among others, announced plans in February 2020 to launch Flashpoint, a franchise-based league for Counter-Strike, countering concerns over the state of the current promotion/relegation leagues.
                    The league was to be owned by the teams rather than a single organization, similar to the Overwatch League.

                <li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was announced on August 12, 2011, 12 years (exactly 146 months or 4,444 days) after Counter-Strike was originally released as a modification (June 12, 1999).</li>
                <li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive did not arrive on the PAL version of PlayStation Store on the official release date, causing fans of the region to react with anger.

                <li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the only Counter-Strike game to be rated 18+ by PEGI.</li>
                <li>In the CS:GO icon, a CT can be seen holding a SCAR-L, a weapon that isn't in the game.</li>
